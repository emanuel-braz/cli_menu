# cli_menu

A library for adding simple menus to console (CLI) apps. It will print
a list of options and then let user choose via keyboard up and down arrows
(when ANSI is available), or via a prompt for a number.

This library is conservative â€“ it prefers compatibility over fancy
features and ANSI and/or unicode "graphics".
